## Overview

`ktest` is a project that makes [kphp](https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp/) programs easier to test.

* `kphp phpunit` can run [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) tests
* `kphp bench` runs benchmark tests (not implemented yet)

## TODO

* Mocks
* Benchmarks

## Limitations

* Assert functions can't be used for objects (class instances)
* No custom comparators for assert functions
